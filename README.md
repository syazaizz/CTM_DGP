# CTM_DGP
Project to Implement the osmological Trajectories Method (CTM) code to a simple modified gravity theory, DGP gravity

# Installation of the CTM code
Before running the CTM_DGP codes, the CTM code should be installed from: https://github.com/franlane94/CTM 

# Calculating Power Spectrum: dgp_ctm_power_spec.py
linear growth $D(z)$ for DGP gravity is calculated,
