# CTM_DGP

Project to Implement the Cosmological Trajectories Method (CTM) code to a simple modified gravity theory, DGP gravity.


# Installation of the CTM code

Before running the CTM_DGP codes, the CTM code should be installed from: https://github.com/franlane94/CTM.


# Calculating Power Spectrum: dgp_ctm_power_spec.py

Computing the linear grwoth factor, D(z) and the power spectrum, P(k) for DGP gravity using the CTM code.  


# Plotting the Results: dgp_ctm_plots.py

The Euclid Emulator data was obtained from: https://github.com/miknab/EuclidEmulator.

To match the code, the Euclid Emulator data need to be saved in a folder called "emulator_runs".
